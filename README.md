# LinearRegression-Paris-Housing-Price-Prediction
Linear regression, Paris housing price prediction, data visualization, data analysis

Housing purchase is one of the most important decisions to make in most peopleâ€™s lives. There are various attributes of houses like number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age, interest rate, and more. This project predicts the housing prices in a specific location (Paris, French in this case) utilizing Linear Regression model. The analysis identifies key factors influencing housing prices, helps investors or home buyers with their purchase decision.

There is a new related dataset with new column category (luxury or basic) available. I will have that classification analysis done recently and add the link here later.
